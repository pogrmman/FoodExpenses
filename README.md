## Introduction
This R Shiny app lets you visualize the 
[USDA's Economic Research Sercive Food Expenditure Series dataset](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-expenditure-series/)

Using this app, you can break down food and alcohol sales in the US by location of purchase and 
whether or not it's intended to be consumed at home. You can also visualize tips and taxes on these purchases and 
also see everything as a percentage of total food/alcohol spending for that year.
